# 🔐 Keystroke Dynamics Authentication

## Revolutionizing Fintech Security Through Behavioral Biometrics

---

## 🚀 Overview
Keystroke Dynamics Authentication is an advanced security solution for fintech applications, leveraging the unique typing patterns of users as a behavioral biometric. This project demonstrates how typing rhythm can be used to authenticate users, making security seamless and user-friendly.

---

## 🧩 Features
- **Behavioral Biometric Authentication**: Uses keystroke dynamics (hold time, flight time, rhythm) for secure login.
- **Modern Streamlit UI**: Clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface.
- **Banking Services Integration**: Demo options for Savings Account, Internet Banking, Home Loan, EMI Calculator, and more.
- **Real-Time Pattern Analysis**: Instant feedback and authentication.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage training, testing, and view authentication results.
- **Secure Session Management**: Logout and fraud alert simulation.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: Python, Pandas
- **Machine Learning**: Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn)
- **Data Storage**: CSV, PKL files

**Flow:**
1. User types a phrase → Keystroke data captured
2. Features extracted → Pattern analyzed
3. ML model trained → Authentication decision
4. Result → Access granted or denied

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Admin Setup**: Record baseline typing pattern and train the authentication model.
2. **User Authentication**: User types a phrase, system analyzes typing pattern, and grants/denies access.
3. **Dual-Layer Security**: Password + Typing pattern for robust protection.

---

## 📊 Results & Impact
- **Accuracy**: 90%+
- **Authentication Speed**: < 3 seconds
- **User Experience**: Zero extra effort
- **Use Cases**: Banking, Payments, E-learning, Corporate logins

---

## 🌱 Future Scope
- Expand to voice and mouse dynamics
- Mobile device integration
- API for third-party fintech apps
- Enterprise deployment
